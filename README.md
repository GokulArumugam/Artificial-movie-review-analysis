# Artificial-movie-review-analysis
## Overview of the task:
If you are planning on going out to see a movie, how well can you trust online reviews and ratings? Especially if the same company showing the rating also makes money by selling movie tickets. Do they have a bias towards rating movies higher than they should be rated?
## Goal:
The project was inspired by the article 538, which stated that the movie rating website 'Fandango' artificially increased the number of movies displayed on the website, despite the fact that few movies are actually rated low. I then decided to see if Fandango's ratings in 2015 were biassed toward rating movies higher in order to sell more tickets.
