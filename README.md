# Artificial-movie-review-analysis
## Overview of the task:
If you are planning on going out to see a movie, how well can you trust online reviews and ratings? Especially if the same company showing the rating also makes money by selling movie tickets. Do they have a bias towards rating movies higher than they should be rated?
## Goal:
The project is inspired from the artice 538, where it is mentioned that Movie ratting website name 'Fandango' artificially increased it's starts diplayed on the website, but the truth it is actually few movies are actually ratted low. I have then decided to see if Fandango's ratings in 2015 had a bias towards rating movies better to sell more tickets.
